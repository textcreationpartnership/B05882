            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>PROPOSALS To the High Court of PARLIAMENT, For Finiſhing the Ancient and Preſent State of SCOTLAND.</head>
            <p n="1">1. THis Work conſiſts of two Volumes, the firſt gives an Account of the Ancient and Preſent State of the Nation, the Contents whereof have already been laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the High Court of Parliament; The ſecond Volume conſiſts only of fine Sculptures, and the whole Deſign when finiſhed, will be one of the fineſt Things which was ever publiſhed for any Nation: It will contain the Planns and Proſpects of the Kings old Caſtles and Palaces, as alſo the chiefeſt Houſes of the Nobility and Gentrey, with an Account when they were Built, by which the World may ſee, that in theſe days they were als conſiderable as other Buildings of this kind which were then Extant; Some of our modern Edifices will compeat with many in other Nations, the Ruines of ſuch magnificent Monaſteries as ſhall be here inſert, and the variety of ſo many pleaſant Proſpects of Towns, will teſtifie the ſame.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Armorial Atchivements of all the Nobility of <hi>Scotland,</hi> with their Supporters, Creſts and Mottos, are to be engraven by the beſt Artiſts in <hi>England,</hi> as alſo the intire Coats of Arms of the chiefeſt Barons in this Nation, with two or three Lynes of Deſcription, relating to the Families they are deſcended of; To which will be added the Arms of all the Royal Burghs, and the Names of their chief Magiſtrats for the time.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The Solemnities uſed at the Baptizms of the Princes of <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Funerals of the Kings, Dukes, and other Peers, and the way of Ryding the Parliament, is to be repreſented in fine Sculptures; by which it will appear, that Solemnities of this Nature are performed here with as much Magnificence as in other parts of the World.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The above mentioned two Volumes will contain about Ten Quair of Royal Paper, conſiſting of above 140 large Talliduces or Prints, the reſt will be the Deſcription of the State of the Nation, and nothing relating to it is to be publiſhed, before it be approven by ſuch as ſhall be appointed to reviſe the ſame. The Paper will coſt 40. <hi>ſh. ſterling</hi> the Rim, ſo that the very Paper, and the Printing of the Copper-Plates will be 30 <hi>ſh. sterling:</hi> And Captain <hi>Slezer</hi> obliges himſelf to furniſh the Liedges with theſe two Volumes in Sheets, at Thirty <hi>ſh. ſterling,</hi> that is to ſay, without a Penny of Profite to himſelf.</p>
            <p n="5">5. For ordering of which, he only propoſes to be reimburſed of the Charges which he hath already beſtowed for carrying on this Work. The ſaid Charges as is inſtructed to the Right Honourable Committee of Trade, do amount to upwards of 1200 <hi>lib. ſterling.</hi> And it hath been likewiſe made appear, that to finiſh the ſame, it will require at leaſt, as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Copy can be Printed or taken off.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:176183:2"/>
            <p n="6">6. From which it is evident, that the Expenſe of this Undertaking, can never be reim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burſed by the Sale of the Book; becauſe the Price would riſe ſo exceſſive high, that it could not be ſold under Six pounds <hi>ſterling.</hi> And all the advantage Captain <hi>Slezer</hi> propoſes to himſelf, in furniſhing the Leidges with theſe Books at the ſame Price they ſtand him, is the expectation he hath to diſpoſe of a few of theſe Copies, at a greater Rate in other places of the World.</p>
            <p n="7">7. It will be neceſſary to know in time, how many of the Leidges are deſirous of theſe Books, that Paper may be provided accordingly. For clearing of which, Captain <hi>Slezer</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to inform himſelf of it by way of Subſcription, and to convince the World of the Since<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of his Intention: he deſigns to take no Subſcription money, till ſuch time as the Privy Council ſhall order the ſame: but he deſires it may be Conſigned in every Shire, in the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectors hands, or any other who ſhall be appointed to receive the ſame; to wit, fifteen <hi>ſhillings</hi> at the Subſcription, and the ſaid perſons appointed to be obliged, not to make any payment of it to Captain <hi>Slezer,</hi> or to any by his order, till it be intimat to them by ſome of the Privy Council, that the Work is ſo far advanced, that the Money Collected for this uſe may be payed to Captain <hi>Slezer.</hi> The reſt of the Subſcription-money is to be payed at the delivery of the Book, as is uſual in the like Caſes, of which a more particular Account and Intimation ſhall be given hereafter.</p>
